          <Note>Release 2.6.1. Updated SPASE Dictionary definitions for Acknowledgement, AssociationType, Author, Authors, DirectionAngle, Encoding, FlowSpeed, FlowVelocity, Format, MagneticCloud, PublicationDate, ReleaseDate, ResourceName, Style, and ThermalSpeed. Added SPASE Dictionary definitions for LocalGeographic, LocalGeomagnetic, and SensorCoordinates and added these terms to the CoordinateSystemName enumeration list. Added SPASE Dictionary definition for StonyhurstHeliographic and added this term to the CoordinateSystemName enumeration list per request of Masahito Nose-san. Added SPASE Dictionary definitions for AOGCM, GCM, and NonHydrostatic and added these terms to the ModelType enumeration list. Updated SPASE Dictionary definition for Electrohydrodynamics and revised the name of the term by deleting the last character, the terminal s, to maintain consistancy with other terms in ModelType enumeration list. Added SPASE Dictionary definition for InterplanetaryCoronalMassEjection and added this term to the PhenomenonType enumeration list. Corrected SPASE Ontology listing of the Cardinality for RepositoryID under AccessInformationOptional to replace the letter r with the number 1 (required). Updated the SPASE Ontology listing of the Cardinality for SpatialCoverage under DisplayData and Granule from + (1 or more) to * (0 or more). Updated the SPASE Ontology listing of the Cardinality for SpatialCoverage under Member and Parameter from 0 (optional) to * (0 or more). Updated the SPASE Ontology listing of the Cardinality for OperatingSpan under Observatory from + (1 or more) to * (0 or more). Updated the SPASE Ontology listing of the Cardinality for OperatingSpan under Instrument from 0 (optional) to * (0 or more). Updated the SPASE Ontology listing of the Cardinality for ModelType under Model from 1 (required) to + (1 or more). Added SPASE Dictionary definitions for SourceRegion and SourceRegionExtent and added these to text fields to the end of the Particle and the Wave containers each with * cardinality (0 or more). Added SPASE Dictionary definition for Lidar and added this term to the InstrumentType enumeration list.Added SPASE Dictionary definition for Muon annnd added it to the ParticleType enumeration list.</Note>

      <Description>Research in Heliophysics requires information from multiple sources which includes data from and about spacecrafts, groundbased observatories, models, simulations and more. The results from research are also invaluable in building up a body of knowledge and need to be available. All the different sources and types of information are considered a &quot;Resource&quot; The Resources exist, are shared, exchanged and used in a framework called the &quot;data environment&quot; The SPASE (Space Physics Archive Search and Extract) group has defined a Data Model which is a set of terms and values along with the relationships between them that allow describing all the resources in a heliophysics data environment. It is the result of many years of effort by an international collaboration of heliophysicists and information scientists to unify and improve on existing Space and Solar Physics data models. The intent of this Data Model is to provide the means to describe resources, most importantly scientifically useful data products, in a uniform way so they may be easily registered, found, accessed, and used.

The Data Model provides enough detail to allow a scientist to understand the content of Data Products (e.g., a set of files for 3 second resolution Geotail magnetic field data for 1992 to 2005), together with essential retrieval and contact information. It also allows for the incremental annotation of resources with expert assessments and the free association of resources to create bundles or networks of resources. Resource descriptions can be stored with the data or at remote locations. Sites can harvest the resource descriptions to enable services like a search engine or portal (Virtual Observatory). A typical use would be to have a collection of descriptions stored in one or more related internet-based registries of products; that can be queried with specifically designed search engines and ultimately link users to the data they need. The Data Model also provides constructs for describing components of such a data delivery system. This includes repositories, registries and services.</Description>
