      <Description>The ECHO (Experiment for Coordinated 
Helioseismic Observations) is a network of two instruments which 
observe solar oscillations as seen in the radial velocity of the 
solar surface. The ECHO will use the next generation of the LOWL 
[Low degree(L)] instrument, which has been operated at the Mauna Loa 
Solar Observatory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research 
for the past several years. The first of the new ECHO instruments 
became operational on Dec 15, 1999 at the Observatorio del Teide, 
located at Izana, Tenerife, Spain. The LOWL instrument at MLSO
was upgraded and became the second instrument in the ECHO 
network.  The LOWL observes the oscillations as perturbations of 
the radial velocity over the surface of the Sun. This is 
accomplished by taking images in narrow bandpass filters 
displaced slightly redward and blueward of a solar absorption 
line.</Description>
