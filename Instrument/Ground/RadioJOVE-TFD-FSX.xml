   <Description>RadioJOVE Terminated Folded Dipole (TFD) and FSX series
   spectrograph systems
   
The terminated folded dipole (TFD) array with 24 foot (7.3
m) elements is designed for a wide bandwidth, from 15 to 30+ MHz, for
HF band radio astronomy. This array has proven very useful for
observing emission from Jupiter, the Sun, and other phenomena present
in the upper half of the HF band. There are two versions of the TFD -
 a 4 element (24 foot each) and an 8 element (30 foot each) variant. AJ4CO has the only
operational 8 element TFD. Both the 4 and 8 element versions are dual
polarization phased array antennas covering 15 to 30+ MHz. Dave
Typinski is the technical contact for the TFD array.

The FSX series of spectrographs are more or less functionally
similar. The main difference is that if there is an "S" at the end
(like FSX-8S) these are polarization switching units while the FSX instruments are
single polarization instruments, all models operate from 15 to 30 MHz. 

The FS200B single polarization spectrographs were developmental
instruments used at the University of Florida Radio Observatory (UFRO)
and Windward Community College Radio Observatory (WCCRO).  After the
demise of UFRO that instrument was moved to the AJ4CO facility. It
covers the same frequency range (15-30 MHz) but uses different
circuitry. Richard S. Flagg is the technical contact for the FSX
series of spectrographs.
