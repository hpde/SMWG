      <Description>The IBEX-Lo instrument measures ENA's in eight energy
bands within the 0.01-2.0 keV range.  The instrument is a single-pixel
imager with a 7x7 deg field of view (FOV) in three 90 deg quadrants and
a 3.5 x 3.5 deg FOV in a fourth, "high resolution" quadrant. 
The eight energy windows overlap and have center energies of 14, 27, 52,
102, 197, 451, 908 and 1903 eV.  These are referred to as bands 1 to 8,
respectively, in data products.  The instrumentation includes a triple-
coincidence time-of-flight mass spectrometer to help distinguish between
heliospheric hydrogen and interstellar oxygen and helium. The instrument
images full 360 deg swaths of the sky each 15-sec spacecraft spin about
the sun-pointing spin axis.  In normal operation, two successive spins
are devoted to each energy window every 16 spin (~4 min) periods.</Description>
