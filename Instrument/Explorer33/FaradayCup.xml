      <Description>A split-collector Faraday cup mounted on the
spacecraft equator was used to study the directional intensity of
solar wind ions and electrons. The following 25-s sequence was executed
three times for ions and once for electrons each 328 s. Twenty-seven
directional current samples from the two collectors were taken in the
energy per charge (E/Q) window from 80 to 2850 eV. The currents in the
two collectors were then sampled in eight E/Q windows between 50 and
5400 eV at the azimuth at which peak current appeared in the previous 27
measurements. Due to telemetry limitations, only the following data were
returned to earth every 328 s: for ions, the sums of currents measured on
the two collector plates twice and the difference once, and for electrons,
the sums once. The experiment worked well from launch until the final
spacecraft data transmission in October, 1971. For further details,
see Lyon et al., J. Geophys. Res., v. 72, p. 6113, 1967.
