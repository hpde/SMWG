   <Description>The Low Frequency Atmospheric Weather Electromagnetic
   System for Observation, Modeling, and Education, or LF AWESOME is a
   high-sensitivity radio receiver for the frequency band 0.5-470 kHz.
   The receiver is an upgraded version of the VLF AWESOME, completed
   in 2004, which provided high sensitivity broadband radio
   measurements of natural lightning emissions, transmitting beacons,
   and radio emissions from the near-Earth space environment.  LF
   AWESOME is a significant upgrade to the VLF AWESOME, in which the
   frequency range has been extended to include the LF and part of the
   medium frequency (MF) bands, the sensitivity improved by 10-25 dB
   to be as low as 0.03 fT/ sqrt(Hz), depending on the frequency, and
   timing error reduced to 15-20 ns range. The expanded capabilities
   allow detection of radio atmospherics from lightning strokes at
   global distances and multiple traverses around the world. It also
   allows monitoring of transmitting beacons in the LF/MF band at
   thousands of km distance. (from the abstract of the LF AWESOME
