      <Description>Each sensor of the GSFC-supplied, boom-mounted triaxial fluxgate
magnetometer had dual ranges of minus to plus 24 nT and 64 nT, with digitization
resolutions of minus to plus 0.094 nT and 0.25 nT, respectively. Zero level drift
was checked by periodic reorientation of the sensors until May 20, 1969, when the
flipper mechanism failed. Past this point, data analysis was more difficult as the
zero level drift of the sensor parallel to the spacecraft spin axis was not readily
determined. Spacecraft interference was less than 0.125 nT. One vector measurement
was obtained each 5.12 s. The bandpass of the magnetometer was 0 to 5 Hz, with a
20-dB per decade decrease for higher frequencies. Except for the flipper failure,
the experiment functioned normally from launch to spacecraft turnoff (June 24, 1973).
For further details, see Ness et al., J. Geophys. Res., v. 72, p. 5769, 1969.
There was also a NASA/ARC-supplied magnetometer on Explorer 35.
