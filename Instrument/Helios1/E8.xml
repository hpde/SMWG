      <Description>The objective of the experiment (E8) was to study the origin 
and the distribution mechanism of low-energy electrons and protons. The 
instrument, a magnetic spectrometer, consisted of six semiconductor detectors 
with the field of view in the plane of the ecliptic. Species separation was 
achieved by an inhomogeneous magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the 
particle path. Four electron and two proton detectors measured electrons 
from 17 to 835 keV and protons from 21 to 677 keV. The proton measurements 
were made with a two-detector telescope employing coincidence and anticoincidence 
logic. Both particle species were measured in 16 energy channels through 
pulse-height analysis. For further information see pp. 261-263 of 
Raumfahrtforschung, v. 19, n. 5, 1975.</Description>
