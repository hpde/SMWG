      <Description>This experiment was designed to measure the differential energy spectra of the isotopes of hydrogen through oxygen from 2 to 40 MeV/nucleon, and of electrons from 0.2 to 5 MeV. The instrument consisted of a stack of 11 fully depleted silicon solid-state detectors surrounded by a plastic scintillator anticoincidence cup. The outer two solid-state detectors were annular, permitting measurements in both narrow-geometry (typical geometrical factor was 0.2 sq cm-sr) and wide-geometry (typical geometric factor was 1.5 sq cm-sr) coincidence modes. Anisotropy data (45-deg angular and 20-s temporal resolution) were obtained. For further details, see R. A. Mewaldt and E. C. Stone, Astrophys. J., v. 205, p. 93, 1976.</Description>
