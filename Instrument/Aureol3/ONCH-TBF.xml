            <Description>The electric and magnetic field probes (ONCH-TBF) on Aureol 3 measured the three components of the magnetic field at frequencies between 10 Hz and 16 kHz. The combined Soviet-French ONCH-TBF onboard instrument was designed to allow comprehensive measurements of both electric and magnetic wave fields. The measurements in real-time modes included 5-component wave-form data in the range 10 Hz - 1.5 kHz for 3 magnetic and 2 electric field components, or a wide-band mode in the range 10 Hz - 1.5 kHz, and several filter banks. In memory modes the data only from several filter-banks in the range from 10 Hz to 16 kHz were recorded. For further details, see Berthelier et al., Ann. Geophys., V. 38, N5, p. 643, 1982.</Description>
