      <Description>This experiment used a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer. Each sensor
       had dual ranges of minus to plus 32 nT and 128 nT and digitization errors of
       minus to plus 0.16 and 0.64 nT, respectively. The operating range could be
       changed by ground command. The sensor parallel to the spin axis was on a 1.8-m
       boom and was flipped every 3.9 d to check the zero level. The other two sensors
       were on a separate boom. Vector measurements were returned each 2.56 s. An
       onboard autocorrelation computer was included. Autocorrelation data based on
       240 samplings were returned on alternate components each 20.45 s. The experiment
       worked well throughout the life of the spacecraft. However, failure of the
       spacecraft optical aspect system on March 4, 1969, rendered impossible the
       determination of the magnetic field direction over the last 2 months of data
       acquisition. For further details, see Fairfield, J. Geophys. Res., v. 74, p.
       3541, 1969. NSSDC has all the useful data that now exist from this investigation.
       Hourly averaged interplanetary data also exist as part of data sets in the NSSDC
       supplementary data file.
