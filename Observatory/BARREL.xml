            <Description>BARREL (Balloon Array for Radiation-belt Relativistic Electron Losses) is a multiple-balloon
   investigation to study particles that escape from the radiation belts and funnel down Earth's magnetic
   field lines toward the poles. It involves two multi-balloon launches from the South African Antarctic
   Station (SANAE IV) and the British station, Halley Bay, with an option for a third Northern Hemisphere
   campaign. During each campaign, 5-8 long-duration balloons payloads (~20 kg) would be launched to an
   altitude of 30-35 km simultaneously for three to 40 days. Each balloon will carry a NaI scintillator to
   measure the Bremsstrahlung X-rays produced by precipitating relativistic electrons as they collide with
   neutrals in Earth's atmosphere to allow an estimate of the total electron loss from the radiation belts.
   The payload also includes a DC magnetometer. Besides the two scientific instruments, each payload includes
   solar panels generating 6 W and an onboard battery for power, a number of sensors to monitor the operation of
   the payload, a GPS receiver to track the position and altitude of the balloon, and an Iridium satellite link
   that transfer all data at a rate of 2 kps.

BARREL is the first NASA Living with a Star Geospace Mission of Opportunity.  Observations are planned for when the
balloon-array will be conjugate with NASA's Van Allen Probes spacecraft, such that direct comparison is possible
between one another.</Description>
