      <Description>The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) is an internationally known facility for
   science and technology research and development related to radio astronomy. Home to NRC astronomers,
   astrophysicists, engineers and technologists, in addition to visiting researchers and students from
   universities and astronomical observatories around the world, these facilities support the design and
   development of leading-edge instrumentation for new and existing telescopes. Operating several
   telescopes on its extensive radio-quiet site near Penticton, DRAO also features laboratories and
   specialized equipment for design and construction of all aspects of radio-frequency instrumentation,
   from highly sensitive antennas and receiver systems, to high speed digital signal processing hardware
   and software. Dominion Radio Astronomical Observatory also provides solar F10.7 radio flux.</Description>
