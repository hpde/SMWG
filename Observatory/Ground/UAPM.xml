         <Description>The Solar-Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP) Polar Network officially began in 1991. Other Data are also available that were obtained in several Campaigns that took place before the official STEP Period. The STEP Program lasted until 1997. The Upper Atmospheric Monitoring Program, UAPM, is strongly associated with STEP. However, STEP continues to provide Data for Public Access including: High and Low Time Resolution (1 s and 1 min, respectively) Data obtained by Fluxgate Magnetometgers, and Induction Magnetometer Data sampled at 10 Hz. The main Data Sources during STEP Period came from Fluxgate and Induction Magnetometers and All-Sky TV Cameras deployed in the northern Polar Region, primarily in Canada and also in Svalbard and in Greenland. This Service is still experimental. Please contact us if you find any Problems.</Description>
