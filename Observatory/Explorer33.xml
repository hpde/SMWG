      <Description>NASA's Explorer 33 spacecraft, also known as
  Anchored IMP A (AIMP A) and as IMP D, was launched into a geocentric
  orbit in July, 1966.  Explorer 33 was a spin-stabilized (spin axis
  parallel to the ecliptic
  plane, spin period varying between 2.2 and 3.6 s) spacecraft instrumented
  for studies of interplanetary plasma, energetic charged particles
  (electrons, protons, and alphas), magnetic fields, and solar X rays
  at lunar distances. The spacecraft failed to achieve lunar orbit but
  did achieve mission objectives. Lunar
  perturbations caused significant variations in orbit parameters
  The initial apogee occurred at about
  1600 h local time. Over the first 3-yr period, perigee varied between
  6 and 44 earth radii. Apogee varied between 70 and 135 earth radii,
  and the inclination with respect to the equator of the earth varied
  between 7 and 60 deg. Periods of principal data coverage (essentially
  100%) are July 1, 1966 (launch), to January 14, 1970; February 21,
  1970, to March 6, 1970; July 31, 1970, to September 14, 1970; January
  15, 1971, to February 28, 1971; March 23, 1971, to May 31, 1971; and
  August 23, 1971, to September 15, 1971. No data were obtained after
  September 21, 1971.
