      <Description>Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk, or GOLD, is a NASA mission launched 
          at 5:20 p.m. EST, Thursday, Jan. 25.  GOLD is intended to perform a two-year mission imaging 
          Earth's thermosphere and ionosphere from geostationary orbit. GOLD is a two-channel far-ultraviolet (FUV) 
          imaging spectrograph built by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of 
          Colorado Boulder and flown as a hosted payload on the commercial communications satellite SES-14.
          SES-14 is a hybrid satellite with C- and Ku-band wide beam coverage, 
          as well as Ku- and Ka-band High Throughput Satellite (HTS) coverage across the 
          Americas and the North Atlantic region. The satellite will fully rely on electric 
          propulsion and will be equipped with an electric plasma propulsion system for orbit 
          raising and in-orbit manoeuvres. The electric propulsion system delivers significant 
          reduction in the weight of the satellite, enabling larger payloads to be carried. 
          The new spacecraft will also feature a Digital Transparent Processor (DTP), increasing 
          the payload flexibility to provide customized bandwidth solutions to SES's customers.
